ACTIVATE SKILL: orchestrator
INSTRUCTION:
1. Snapshot current context (module-graph, etc.) to `SESSION_PLAN.json`.
2. Create a new task "Analyze {{args}}" in `SESSION_PLAN.json` (assigned_to: orchestrator, status: in_progress).
3. Use `search_file_content` (ripgrep) and `glob` to scan the codebase efficiently.
4. If external patterns found, use `google_web_search` or `web_fetch` to verify best practices.
5. Log findings as new tasks or memory axioms.
6. Mark analysis task `completed`.
