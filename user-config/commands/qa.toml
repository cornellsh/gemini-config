INSTRUCTION:
1. Identify all tasks in SESSION_PLAN.json with status "completed".
2. For each task, execute the specific test suites required by the OpenSpec scenarios.
3. Use run_shell_command for active verification (prioritize sandbox).
4. Scan for security leaks or forbidden patterns using ripgrep.
5. Adjudicate results: update to "qa_passed" or revert to "pending" with a technical rejection reason.
